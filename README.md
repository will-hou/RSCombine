# RSCombine
A simple script that combines two separate [Robot Scouter](https://github.com/SUPERCILEX/Robot-Scouter) exports into one JSON file 

Scouts from the second file will be added to the first file under their appropriate teams.

The combined JSON file will be created in the same directory as the first file and named
`[filename1]_[filename2]_combined.json`
